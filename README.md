# PWMGenerator

This arduino code allows you to generate a PWM signal.

This code uses two ways for that :
  - a potentiometer (pin A0)
  - two buttons for fine-tuning (pin 2 and 3).
  
Button 2 allows you to decrease the PWM signal by one.  
Button 3 allows you to increase the PWM signal by one.

By pusshing the button 2 and 3 at the same time, you will zero out the fine tuning.

You can estimate the PWM signal by the brightness of led 13.
